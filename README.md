# kanjijiten-webscraper
Webscraper to get kanji information from the site: https://kanjitisiki.com

## About the Project
This webscraper was build to gather kanji data and store it in .csv files which can be later used to design a database of kanji for cataloging kanji, create applications or other personal/enterprise uses.

## Project Motivations
First, it is always an interesting reminder that the "japanese alphabet" does not consinst of a small set of letters like the alphabets that are latin based. It has over 3000 distinct character used in daily life and around 30,000 characters in total. Although most of these character are never used or have very rare occurences, it is always necessary to have them cataloged just in case it appears somewhere. Also, each letter has one or more meanings and also a set of possible readings (chinese readings and japanese readings).

## Current Status
As for now, the project is capable of gathering over 10,000 kanji from the website: https://kanjitisiki.com, including, general information (character, unicode, number of strokes and other), meanings, variant characters and more. All the kanji gathered belong to the [JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_encoding). The site used to gather the kanji data from seems unupdated since 2022, therefore, a webscraper of a constantly updated website is recommended as to better the data and to enlarge it. As for the code itself, it needs to be reviewed in other to become more organized and legible.
